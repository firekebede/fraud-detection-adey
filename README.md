# Fraud Detection - Adey Innovations Inc.

This project builds robust machine learning models to detect fraudulent e-commerce and banking transactions. It also incorporates explainability techniques (SHAP) and geolocation analysis for insights and trust.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess financial transaction datasets
- Engineer fraud-aware features and detect patterns
- Handle class imbalance and tune fraud detection models
- Interpret model decisions using explainable AI (XAI)
